We are a creative hub that stimulates the senses and engages the mind. A celebration of the limitless imagination that resides within us all.

Mad Arts showcases artists, designers, and creatives whose work disrupts, provokes, and transforms what art and technology can achieve, seeking to close the gap between the artist and viewer to expand digital horizons. 

This year, Mad Arts is ready for a new level of experiential artwork driven by emerging technologies. The opening of the new permanent home in Dania Beach marks a watershed moment for South Florida in a 50,000 sq ft building dedicated to showcasing and exploring immersive art, digital technologies, and outdoor activations. Boasting an outdoor garden and more than triple the current gallery space, the expansion enables Mad Arts to present an ambitious tech-driven program.  

The opening will have more than twenty exhibitions from a diverse range of artistic voices and perspectives across the arts and technology sectors on a local, national, and international level.

These projects include performances and recordings with Cliff Barbado, Bobby Blue Bland, Ravi Coltrane, Frank Foster, Winard Harper, Jimmy Heath, Vincent Herring, John Hicks, Charli Persip, Ralph Peterson, Lonnie Plaxico, Bobby Short, Cedar Walton, Frank Wess, Nancy Wilson and The Skatalites, to name a few.Pelt frequently performs alongside such notable ensembles as the Roy Hargrove Big Band, The Village Vanguard Orchestra and the Duke Ellington Big Band, and is a member of the Lewis Nash Septet and The Cannonball Adderley Legacy Band featuring Louis Hayes. As a leader, Pelt has recorded ten albums and has toured globally with his various ensembles, appearing at many major jazz festivals and concert venues.Pelts recordings and performances have earned him critical acclaim, both nationally and internationally. He has been featured in the Wall Street Journal by legendary jazz writer and producer, Nat Hentoff, and was voted Rising Star on the trumpet, five years in a row by Downbeat Magazine and the Jazz Journalist Association.

The bands unique sound has allowed it to endure for nearly four decades and appeal to fans, young and old, all over the world. When The English Beat (known as The Beat in their native England) rushed on to the music scene in 1979, it was a time of massive social and political unrest and economic and musical upheaval. This set the stage for a period of unbridled musical creativity, and thanks in large part to the Punk movement and its DIY approach to making music, artists like The Beat were able to speak out and speak their mind on the news of the day, as in Stand Down Margaret, things that mattered to them and the youth culture, as in Get A Job, and universal matters of the heart and soul, as in their classic hits I Confess and Save It For Later. The Beat first came to prominence as founding members of the British Two Tone Ska movement, with their classic first album Just Cant Stop It fitting squarely in that genre. Along with their contemporaries The Specials, The Selecter, and Madness, the band became an overnight sensation and one of the most popular and influential bands of that movement. However, band leader Dave Wakeling never felt constrained by the movement. The band crossed over fluidly between soul, reggae, pop and punk, and from these disparate pieces they created an infectious dance rhythm. The bands sound continued to evolve over their three studio albums, through the General Public era (a band formed by Dave with The Beats toaster, Ranking Roger), and it has continued its evolution with the forthcoming English Beat album Here We Go Love, a PledgeMusic crowd-funded album set for a 2016 release, the bands first new album since 1982s Special Beat Service. Consummate showman that he is, Dave Wakeling continues to keep The Beat alive and strong, touring the world as The English Beat with an amazing all-star ska backing band playing all the hits of The Beat, General Public, and songs from his new album Here We Go Love. You just cant stop The English Beat!",*All shows are General Admission. *All shows are standing room only unless otherwise noted. *You will need your Valid Picture ID should use wish to consume adult beverages. *Ticket purchasers will be scanned-in when the Magic Bag doors open on your event day. *Please refer to the event listing for any age restrictions. *Included in your fee is a 3 % credit card processing fee.,standard,USD,79.5,179.5,2024-08-23T14:00:00Z,False,False,2024-11-30T23:55:00Z,2024-12-01T00:00:00Z,False,,False,2024-11-30,19:00:00,2024-12-01T00:00:00Z,False,False,False,False,,,,False,False,America/New_York,onsale,False,/discovery/v2/events/rZ7HnEZ1AKro_d?locale=en-us,/discovery/v2/venues/rZ7HnEZ17FoOA?locale=en-us,The Magic Bag,venue,rZ7HnEZ17FoOA,False,https://www.ticketweb.com/venue/the-magic-bag-ferndale-mi/211805,en-us,48220,America/New_York,Ferndale,Michigan,MI,United States Of America,US,22920 Woodward Avenue,,-83.134773,42.461839,42.0,42,0,/discovery/v2/venues/rZ7HnEZ17FoOA?locale=en-us,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The core of the Chopteeth sound is Afrobeat: a big-band funk invented by Fela Kuti in 1970s Nigeria. Afrobeat is a spicy stew of modern jazz, Yoruba tribal music and burning, James Brown-inspired rhythms. Chopteeths sets feature original compositions along with updates of African dance classics, all while remaining true to the spirit of the music and its message. Band members step to the mic to serve up lyrics in a total of seven different languages. Chopteeth has performed on shows with a wide range of critically acclaimed world music, soul and jazz-funk groups, including Parliament Funkadelic, Trombone Shorty, Galactic, Aaron Neville, Cyril Neville, Derek Trucks Band, Ozomatli, Grupo Fantasma, Konono No. 1, Sierra Leones Refugee All Stars, Govt Mule, Soulive, Greyboy Allstars, The Iguanas, War, Chuck Brown and many more.
